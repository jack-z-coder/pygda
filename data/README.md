## Datasets
* **Airport**: It has 3 different domains, i.e., Brazil, Euroup and USA. They are adopted from the [struc2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03165) and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zlluWoeukD33ZxwaTRQi3jCdD0qC-I2j?usp=share_link). The graph processing can be found at ``AirportDataset``. We utilize ``OneHotDegree`` to construct node features for each node.
* **Blog**: It has 2 different domains, i.e., Blog1 and Blog2. They are adopted from the [ACDNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07366) and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jKKG0o7rEY-BaVEjBhuGijzwwhU0M-pQ?usp=share_link). The graph processing can be found at ``BlogDataset``.
* **Citation**: It has 3 different domains, i.e., ACMv9 , Citationv1 and DBLPv7. They are adopted from the [ASN](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3482228) and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ntNt3qHE4p9Us8Re9tZDaB-tdtqwV8AX?usp=share_link). The graph processing can be found at ``CitationDataset``.
* **MAG**: The MAG dataset is originally from the ogbn-mag dataset and the [PairAlign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01092) separates it into 6 countries, including CN, DE, FR, JP, RU, and US. The data can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HinhjpNPPivyqoubiYOr8X2jq-rjw3e9?usp=share_link) and the graph processing can be found at ``MAGDataset``.
* **Twitch**: It has 6 different domains, i.e., DE, EN, ES, FR,PT and RU. They are adopted from the [Twitch Social Networks](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/datasets?tab=readme-ov-file#twitch-social-networks) and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GWMyyJOZ4CeeqP_H5dCA5voSQHT0WlXG?usp=share_link). The graph processing can be found at ``TwitchDataset``.
